What would you do if we told you that one day soon you may be able to see in the dark? Or that you'll have the ability to 'zoom' in on objects to make them appear larger just by looking at them? You'd probably laugh and tell us that is the stuff of superheroes! However, believe it or not, a number of companies have already announced they're researching smart contact lens technology that could accelerate vision beyond natural human capabilities. 
You can wear basic smart contact lenses like a normal contact lens; they don’t require surgery and can be inserted or removed by the user. They sit on the eyeball and contain micro versions of existing technology.

The advanced smart lens involves a surgical replacement of your existing lens with an electronic one. Fluid is injected into the eye, fusing with the lens capsule as it solidifies. This has the same technological features but is more robust and permanent. The artificial lens takes over the job of focusing light on the retina, improving vision in a flexible way. However, they’re likely to be just as comfortable as normal lenses. Smart lenses are designed to harvest energy. The two methods being discussed are solar power sensors, to convert light to electrical power, and piezoelectric sensors, to convert the mechanical eye movement of blinking into electrical power.
As a vision-based technology, smart contact lenses are an obvious way to explore virtual and augmented reality, and camera technologies. Samsung is working on a way to project visual information directly into the retina of the eye so that the field of vision is altered. It functions like a tiny version of Google Glass and would create a mixed reality experience.

Sony has applied for a patent for a smart contact lens which can convert eye movement into electrical power, which you control through blinking your eyes. The lens can actually store images or video once recorded.

Giving the eye its own power to change its focal length of what they can already see. Manage to see things the human eye has never been able to see before.
